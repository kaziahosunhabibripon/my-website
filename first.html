                If you have collected data for a classification or regression predictive modeling problem, it may be the First time ever, in all of history, that the problem has been modeled. You are breaking new ground. That is not to say that the class of problems has not been tackled before; it probably has and you can learn from what was found if results were published. But it is today that your specific collection of <span> makes your predictive modeling problem unique.</span> As such, the majority of your project will be spent on the data. Gathering data, verifying data, cleaning data, visualizing data, transforming data, and so on.

                Your job is to discover how to best expose the learning algorithms to the unknown underlying structure of your prediction problem. The path to get there is through data preparation. In order for you to be an effective machine learning practitioner, you must know:
                The different types of data preparation to consider on a project.
                The top few algorithms for each class of data preparation technique.
                When to use and how to configure top data preparation techniques.

                This is often hard-earned knowledge, as there are few resources dedicated to the topic. Instead, you often must scour literature for papers to get an idea of what's available and how to use it. Practitioners agree that the vast majority of time in building a machine learning pipeline is spent on feature engineering and data cleaning. Yet, despite its importance, the topic is rarely discussed on its own.
